  <Paragraph>
    This section of the user manual defines the formal specification for the
    <Term type="package">medrina</Term>
    package. The purpose of the specification is to provide a description of the expected behaviour of the
    package, along with proofs of correctness of various properties of the specification
    <LinkFootnote target="4814cd9d-148c-45c3-b077-65b1159a65c7"/>.

  <Footnote id="4814cd9d-148c-45c3-b077-65b1159a65c7">
    Note that the proofs of correctness do not constitute proof that the <Term type="term">implementation</Term>
    of the <Term type="package">medrina</Term> package is correct; the implementation code is manually translated
    from the specification code, and this allows for human error in the transcription and the possibility of
    differing semantics of the execution environment. The specification itself is intended to provide an unambiguous
    description of the behaviour that an implementation <Term type="term">should</Term> have, and the proofs of
    correctness are intended to demonstrate the absence of design flaws in the system as specified.
