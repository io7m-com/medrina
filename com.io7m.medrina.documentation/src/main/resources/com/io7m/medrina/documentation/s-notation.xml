    <Paragraph>
      The formal specification described here is written in the
      <LinkExternal target="https://coq.github.io/doc/master/refman/">Gallina specification language of the Coq theorem
        prover</LinkExternal>. The language is a total, pure-functional, dependently-typed language allowing for
      describing systems in rigorous detail including machine-checked proofs of various chosen properties.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Readers are not expected to be able to understand the bodies of the proof texts, and doing so is not in any case
      required. As long as one can understand the meaning of the <Term type="term">propositions</Term> being expressed,
      it suffices to trust that the proofs are correct as they are all machine-checked whenever the specification is
      published.

    <Paragraph>
      The specification makes reference to the
      <LinkExternal target="https://www.unicode.org">Unicode</LinkExternal>
      character set which, at the time of writing, is at version 15.0.0. The specification often references specific
      Unicode characters, and does so using the standard notation <Term type="constant">U+NNNN</Term>, where <Term type="constant">
      N
    </Term> represents a hexadecimal digit. For example,
      <Term type="constant">U+03BB</Term>
      corresponds to the lowercase lambda symbol
      <Term type="constant">Î»</Term>.
